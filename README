# tinyblog, a frugal weblog engine

`tinyblog` is my personal hobby project. Its aim is to create a truly minimal blog engine which can be operated by an administrator using common file-management tools (by default), while allowing easy expansion.
Similar in spirit to [nanoblogger](http://nanoblogger.sourceforge.net), but vastly different in its architecture and implementation, it strives to depend on very little and be simple to use.

## Goals

* Simplicity of design
* Elegant code structure with a clear separation of concerns
* Quality-assured code with strict invariant keeping
* Few or no dependencies wherever possible
* Portability to different back-ends and template engines
* Performance

## Features

The following features are currently supported:
* Post loading via a Repository
	* File storage backend (fs)
	* In-memory static index backend (Object); refreshing requires process restart for now
	* Automatic index population upon startup
* Single post view
* Post index/listing
* Lightweight, fast templating via [Juicer](http://juicer.name/)
* A basic, ad-hoc RegExp route system

On the roadmap for the near future are:
* Static file serving support (images, stylesheets)
* Proper request routing tree and handler registration API
* Module injection system for the BlogEngine component
* Pagination
* Text and range-based search/filtering (via a Repository)
* In-line comment/discussion system (user annotations?)
